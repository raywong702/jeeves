# Jeeves - Python Task Manager
Jeeves was created to be a cli command line solution. The concept of this is to create tasks that can go with you anywhere on any platform. This is why the program writes to JSON to make the information readable by any program or application that accepts JSON Syntax.

***Legacy Application Available***

IF you are interested in using the legacy v0.14 of Jeeves feel free to try it out.
